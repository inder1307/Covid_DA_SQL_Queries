# 🦠 COVID-19 SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, focusing on case numbers, deaths, vaccinations, and key statistical metrics. It involves manipulating and querying data from two datasets—**Covid Deaths** and **Covid Vaccinations**—to extract meaningful insights that can be used for further analysis and visualization.

## 🔍 Key SQL Operations Performed
- Calculating **mortality rate** by country and over time.
- Analyzing **cumulative incidence rate** (percentage of people infected).
- Computing **rolling vaccination counts** using window functions.
- Filtering out continent-level data for accurate country-based results.
- Grouping data by location and continent to assess regional trends.
- Using **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) and **temporary tables** for cleaner and reusable queries.
- Creating **views** for reusable query logic in BigQuery.

## 📊 Objective
The ultimate goal is to prepare clean, query-optimized datasets that serve as a foundation for data visualization in tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Use the provided SQL queries in BigQuery or any SQL-based analytics engine.
3. Modify queries to fit your region or analysis focus.
4. Connect cleaned datasets to visualization tools for insights.

## 📈 Future Work
- Integrate the final datasets with a visualization dashboard.
